Kicad files for 3d polyhedrons whose edges are single pcbs.
Mechanical design files (used to create a jig for assembly, dxf pcb edge cuts, and stand) can be found on onshape: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/2b28f32d3c45028b2ca3b83c/w/f6f68f4f6320d1f011d99ec9/e/1862cafe5ff15b43acebc721?renderMode=0&uiState=65f6e3c7d6b7cf5145787542

first batch of 40 pcbs, produced by PCBWay at a cost of <Â£10 including shipping. These don't have tounge and groove joints in the corner:

The pcbs were placed in a jig and soldered at the corners (ground is in the very corner, VCC forms a ring around ground)

Tongue and groove versions of icosahedron not tested yet.

Snub cube pcbs with tongue and groove joints are also designed but not yet tested.
