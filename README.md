Kicad files for 3d polyhedrons whose edges are single pcbs.
Mechanical design files (used to create a jig for assembly, dxf pcb edge cuts, power supply, and stand) can be found on onshape: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/2b28f32d3c45028b2ca3b83c/w/f6f68f4f6320d1f011d99ec9/e/1862cafe5ff15b43acebc721?renderMode=0&uiState=65f6e3c7d6b7cf5145787542

first batch of 40 pcbs, produced by PCBWay at a cost of <Â£10 including shipping. These don't have tounge and groove joints in the corner:

The pcbs were placed in a jig and soldered at the corners (ground is in the very corner, VCC forms a ring around ground)

assempled with LEDs soldered:

Sanded down the LEDs to diffuse the light, cut off the legs of the LEDs, printed a stand:

Tongue and groove versions of icosahedron assembled in the same way

bit more margin for error, so easier to solder the corners

Orange LEDs sanded down (takes some time, diffuse LEDs are available to buy instead!), and soldered on

3d printed power supply case takes USB-C, has a switch, and outputs the right voltage for the LEDs

## Snub Cube

Snub cube pcbs with tongue and groove joints go together in a similar way. There are two different PCBs - the square and triangle edges.

All corners are identical, so you only need one jig, and the jig tells you which of the two edges to use.

All PCBs soldered together

I bought some flat-top LEDs (which are less directional), and tested they run in parallel ok. In the final build I did notice a slight difference in brightness, but it isn't a big effect.

All LEDs soldered (and legs cut off)
